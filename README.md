# ESP32 PACKTool

❓ Why do this?

Because the firmware generated by espidf is a bin file of multiple partitions, I want to merge it to facilitate flashing and distribution.

⭕How to use this tool?

1. You should use 'idf.py build' to build your firmware first,then you will find a folder named 'build'.

2. Change the [pkg]Repo selection of `config.toml` to your project folder.

3. In the `config.toml`,you can modify each option. 

   - [pkg] Used to configure the firmware path and generated file name
   - [esp32] Each esp32 has an independent node, Type can choose usb or uart,Firmware will be automatically changed to the latest file name during the pack phase.

4. Shell command

   ```shell
   # pack your firmware
   python pack.py -t esp32c3 -p
   # flash your firmware
   python pack.py -t esp32c3 -r
   # pack and flash your firmware
   python pack.py -t esp32c3 -pr
   ```
